### QR Code Format

**Generated QR:**

```

**Format:**
- Prefix: `LOCALDROP:`
- Device ID: Random alphanumeric (e.g., `DEVXYZ123ABC`)
- Device Name: User-chosen name
- Separator: Colon `:`

**Scanner Parsing:**
```javascript
const parts = qrData.split(':');

```

### Connection Flow

```

   Reads: LOCALDROP:DEV123:Laptop

3. Parser extracts:
   - ID: DEV123
   - Name: Laptop

4. Validates:
   - Starts with LOCALDROP? ✅
   - Has 3 parts? ✅
   - Not same device? ✅

5. Adds to connectedPeers Map:
   DEV123 -> {id, name, connectedAt}
