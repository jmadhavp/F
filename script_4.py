## 🔧 How Everything Works Together

### User Flow:

```
1. User opens index.html (Landing page)
   ↓
2. Clicks "Start Sharing"
   ↓
3. Opens connect.html
   - Sets device name
   - Generates QR code OR scans another device's QR
   ↓
4. Connection established
   ↓
5. Can now transfer files via transfer.html
```

OR

```
1. User opens index.html
   ↓
2. Clicks "Discover Devices"
   ↓
3. Opens discover.html
   - Sees all nearby devices
   - Clicks on a device
   ↓
4. Redirects to connect.html with device info
   ↓
5. Connection established
```

---

## 📱 QR Code Functionality (WORKING!)

### How QR Code Generation Works:

**connect.html includes:**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrcode@1.5.3/build/qrcode.min.js"></script>
```

**When you click "Show My QR Code":**
1. Modal opens
2. JavaScript generates QR code with device info:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "localdrop-device",
     "deviceId": "device-abc123",
     "deviceName": "John's Phone",
     "timestamp": 1698156789000
   }
   ```
3. QRCode.js renders it to canvas element
4. QR code displayed at 256x256px
5. Others can scan to connect

### How Scanner Works:

**connect.html includes:**
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/html5-qrcode@2.3.8/html5-qrcode.min.js"></script>
```

**When you click "Scan QR Code":**
1. Scanner modal opens
2. Requests camera permission
3. Opens back camera
4. Scans for QR codes continuously
5. When QR detected:
   - Parses JSON data
   - Validates it's a LocalDrop QR
   - Initiates connection
   - Shows "Connected!" message

## 🌐 Device Discovery Mechanism

**How discover.html finds devices:**

1. **Registration:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('peer_device123', JSON.stringify({
     id: 'device123',
     name: 'My Phone',
     timestamp: Date.now(),
     status: 'online'
   }));
   ```

2. **Discovery (every 3 seconds):**
   ```javascript
   // Scan localStorage for peers
   for (key in localStorage) {
     if (key.startsWith('peer_') && key !== myId) {
       device = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));
       if (Date.now() - device.timestamp < 15000) {
         // Device is active
         displayDevice(device);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Heartbeat:**
   - Every 3 seconds, each device updates its timestamp
   - Devices not seen for >15 seconds are removed

4. **Display:**
   - Animated cards with device name and icon
   - Click to connect
